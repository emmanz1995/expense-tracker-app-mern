This was my first time applying SOLID principles to my node application, so this project is a working progress.

I plan to continue adding and adapting this project as time goes on. 

Please feel free to clone this application and create a new branch to contribute to the project.

If there is any bugs that you have found in the app you can contact me by email here to report the bug: eokuchukwu95@gmail.com.

##About the Backend
Before you can run the backend locally you need to ensure you are connected to your database, below you will find a line of code that is needed in your .env file:

    DB_MONGODB_URI = 'Your mongo connection string'

Once your DB is connected successfully you can now go to your terminal and run this command first:

    npm install or npm i
This command installs all the dependencies that you will need to run the back successfully.

<br />
Then finally you can start the backend by typing in the following command in your terminal:

    npm run dev
